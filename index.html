            <p>Hi, I’m Joshua Ogbonna, I specialize in coding and web developing with in-depth 
                experience in UI/UX design. In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations 
                address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website navigation and 
                layout to a company’s web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within front-end back-end 
                web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. 
                I’m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read.
